**************************************************************

Overview:
---------
This program implements a library management system using hash tables
for efficient storage and retrieval of books and borrowers.

Data Structures:
----------------
- Book Structure (struct Book): Represents a book with attributes
  including ID, title, author, lending status (is_lent), due date,
  and a pointer to the next book.
  
- Borrower Structure (struct Borrower): Represents a borrower with
  attributes such as ID, name, and a linked list (borrowed_books) of
  books they have borrowed.
  
- BorrowedBook Structure (struct BorrowedBook): Represents a single
  borrowed book, linked in a list within the Borrower structure.
  
- HashTable Structure (struct HashTable): Contains arrays (books and
  borrowers) to store pointers to Book and Borrower structures
  respectively, utilizing a hash function for indexing.

Key Functions:
--------------
- Hash Function (unsigned int hash(int key)): Computes hash values
  based on book and borrower IDs for efficient indexing in the hash
  table.
  
- Create Functions (create_book, create_borrower): Allocate memory
  and initialize new Book and Borrower structures.
  
- Insert Functions (insert_book, insert_borrower): Insert Book and
  Borrower structures into the hash table.
  
- Find Functions (find_book, find_borrower): Search for Book and
  Borrower structures by their IDs in the hash table.
  
- Remove Functions (remove_book, remove_borrower): Remove Book and
  Borrower structures from the hash table.
  
- Lending and Returning Functions (lend_book, return_book): Manage
  book lending and returning operations, updating statuses and due
  dates.
  
- Utility Functions (track_overdue_books, print_borrowed_books,
  print_borrowers, print_books): Track overdue books, and print
  details of borrowed books, borrowers, and all books in the library.
  
- Menu Function (menu): Provides an interactive menu for users to
  register accounts, add/remove books, borrow/return books, track
  overdue books, and print library information.

Main Function:
--------------
- Initializes a HashTable structure.
- Inserts sample books into the hash table for demonstration purposes.
- Invokes the menu function to start the interactive interface for
  users.

Features:
---------
- Efficient data management using hash tables for quick access and
  modification of book and borrower records.
  
- Dynamic memory allocation and linked list management for handling
  borrowed books by borrowers.
  
- Basic interactive menu interface allowing users to perform various
  library management operations.

Note:
-----
This implementation serves as a foundational example of a library
management system in C. For practical use or larger-scale
applications, enhancements such as database integration, user
authentication, and error handling improvements would be necessary.
